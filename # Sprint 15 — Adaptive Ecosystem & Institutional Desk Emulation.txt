# Sprint 15 ‚Äî Adaptive Ecosystem & Institutional Desk Emulation

## 1) Multi-Strategy Orchestration

**Goal:** run multiple tactical ‚Äúdesks‚Äù inside one ecosystem.

**Features**

* Define **strategy groups** (Swing, Scalp, Edge Cases, Research Hypotheses).
* Each group has its own risk budget, confluence weights, and schedule.
* Global Orchestrator allocates trades between groups based on performance.
* Snapshots/journals expanded with `"strategy_group":"Swing"` field.
* Operator can toggle groups on/off mid-session.

## 2) Adaptive Ecosystem Learning

**Goal:** the system tunes itself over long horizons.

**Features**

* Weekly research cycle:

  * Export stats for all groups.
  * Identify underperforming engines.
  * Suggest weight changes (e.g., lower momentum weight if weak).
* Operator receives `event:"ecosystem_suggestion"` journal entries.
* Suggestions advisory-only; must be accepted in UI to apply.

## 3) Meta-Research Layer

**Goal:** institutional-style ‚Äúdesk research archive.‚Äù

**Features**

* `/docs/research/` grows into a **catalogue of tested edges**:

  * Each edge stored with: name, conditions, stats, activation frequency, ROI.
  * Linked directly to journal evidence.
* UI ‚ÄúResearch Library‚Äù tab lets operators browse, filter, and tag edges.
* Hypotheses evolve into confirmed strategies over time.

## 4) Institutional Desk Simulation

**Goal:** emulate how a professional desk allocates capital & risk.

**Features**

* Heat budget split across groups (Swing 40%, Scalp 30%, Edge 20%, Research 10%).
* Risk dynamically rebalanced weekly based on Sharpe-like ratios.
* Journal `event:"allocation_change"` rows record adjustments.
* UI displays allocation rings & capital flows between strategies.

## 5) Long-Term Governance & Resilience

**Goal:** ensure stability over years, not just weeks.

**Features**

* Automatic archive pruning & compression (old journals rotated into yearly archives).
* Equity curve tracking across years.
* Governance review cycle every 90 days ‚Äî journal `event:"governance_review"`.
* Self-diagnostics to warn of obsolescence (e.g., schema drift, stale playbooks).
