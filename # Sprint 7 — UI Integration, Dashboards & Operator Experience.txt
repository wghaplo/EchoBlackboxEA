# Sprint 7 ‚Äî UI Integration, Dashboards & Operator Experience

## 1) UI Schema Sync & Validation

* **Schema guards:** UI validates incoming JSON snapshots/journals against `snapshot@1.3` / `journal@1.3` schemas.
* **Forward compatibility:** UI tolerates new optional fields (per contract).
* **Error states:** If required blocks missing ‚Üí show placeholder + warning banner.
* **Version awareness:** If snapshot/journal schema not recognised, UI shows ‚Äúunsupported schema‚Äù notice.

---

## 2) Orientation Dashboard

* **Orientation Page**:

  * Compass dial (üìà=12 o‚Äôclock, ‚ö°=3, ‚ôª=9, ‚õî=6).
  * Mode history strip (last N snapshots).
  * Alignment score bar (green/red fill).
  * Hard/Soft NO-GO chips with emoji.
* **Operator Impact:** instantly see if the system is greenlit or blocked, and why.

---

## 3) Confluence Matrix (multi-timeframe grid)

* Columns = Timeframes (M1, M5, M15, H1, H4).
* Rows = Engines (Trend, Momentum, Volume, Volatility, Patterns, SR, Correlation, Session/News).
* Each cell = score (color + emoji).
* Total column at right = weighted total.
* **Operator Impact:** quickly compare bias across timeframes.

---

## 4) Edge Cases Panel

* Group by Family (Liquidity/Structure, Volatility/State, Sentiment/External).
* Display active cases with emoji, case name, score, and conditions.
* Show risk cap badges (0.25%, 0.50%).
* Distinguish **opportunistic** vs **core** setups.

---

## 5) Account & Risk Dashboards

* **Header strip (always visible):** Balance, Equity, Free Margin, Floating PnL, Heat-cap OK? (green/red badge).
* **Account Page:**

  * Equity curve + drawdown chart.
  * Risk budget rings (daily/weekly heat).
  * Performance KPIs (Win rate, Expectancy, Payoff, Streaks).
* **Calculator Panel:** What-if lot sizing, RR projection, Kelly overlay.

---

## 6) Journal Explorer

* Stream table of events (`orientation|setup|execution|fill|close|error`).
* Filters by symbol, timeframe, event type.
* Expand row = full JSON payload.
* Show R metrics (MAE, MFE, final R, exit reason).
* Link journal rows to snapshots ‚Üí context view.

---

## 7) Sessions & News View

* Session bar timeline (Tokyo, London, NY, overlaps).
* Overlay news events (‚ö°üì¢) with impact color.
* Highlight ‚Äúnews lockout‚Äù windows.

---

## 8) Operator Alerts

* **UI notifications:**

  * Mode flip (‚õî‚Üíüìà etc.).
  * Edge case activated.
  * Heat cap breach.
  * Override required.
* **Delivery channels:** in-app pop-up, optional email/push integration.
