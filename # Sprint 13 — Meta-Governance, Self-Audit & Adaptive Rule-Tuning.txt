# Sprint 13 — Meta-Governance, Self-Audit & Adaptive Rule-Tuning

## 1) System Health & Self-Audit

**Goal:** EA evaluates itself, not just the market.

**Features**

* `meta.health` block expanded:

  * `uptime_hours`, `last_snapshot_ok`, `last_journal_ok`.
  * Task queue stats (from Sprint 10): % executed vs skipped.
  * Error rate per module (indicators, IO, external feeds).
* Weekly self-audit row in journal:

  * Summarises errors, skipped tasks, uptime, schema compliance.
* UI “Health Panel”: green/yellow/red system status.

## 2) Governance Rules & Enforcement

**Goal:** enshrine safety & ethics.

**Features**

* Configurable **Governance Flags** in CONFIG\_DEFAULTS:

  * `AllowHighRiskOverride` (false default).
  * `MaxDailyTrades`.
  * `EnableAutoResearchTrades` (always false until Sprint >20?).
* EA logs governance state in `meta.governance{}` snapshot:

  * `override_allowed`, `heat_cap_ok`, `trading_enabled`.
* All overrides → explicit `event:"override"` journal rows with reason + operator.

---

## 3) Adaptive Rule-Tuning

**Goal:** adjust *risk discipline* automatically when system underperforms.

**Features**

* Rolling performance monitor (expectancy, max DD).
* If DD > X% or expectancy <0 → EA clamps risk% down (e.g., halve `DefaultRiskPct`).
* Recovery mode: risk returns to normal only after N winners.
* All adaptive actions logged: `event:"adaptive_tune"` with before/after values.

---

## 4) Ethical Constraints

**Goal:** prevent misuse, enforce transparency.

**Features**

* Hardcoded: no hidden auto-trading (must be enabled in inputs).
* No silent schema drift (schema bumps required).
* Any external API use logged (`external.sources_used`).
* Optional operator notes field in journal for manual annotation of ethics decisions.

---

## 5) Operator Feedback Loop

* EA periodically asks for operator confirmation (“Continue with current governance settings?”).
* UI provides one-click **Confirm / Adjust**.
* Journal logs operator decisions as `event:"governance_confirm"`.
* Builds an auditable trail of not just trades, but *discipline choices*.
