# Sprint 11 ‚Äî Collaborative Networking & Multi-Node Operation

## 1) Telemetry Sharing (Local ‚Üí Remote)

**Goal:** allow multiple operators or machines to view the same telemetry.

**Features**

* Optional `WebSocket` or `HTTP POST` bridge from EA ‚Üí local server.
* Journals and snapshots streamed into a central datastore (e.g., SQLite, Elastic, TimescaleDB).
* UI can connect to either **local files** or **network endpoint**.
* Configurable in `CONFIG_DEFAULTS` (`EnableNetworkBridge`, `BridgeURL`).
* **Security:** simple token or API key; TLS if possible.

## 2) Multi-Node Journaling

**Goal:** merge journals from several EAs or accounts.

**Features**

* Journals stamped with `{ account_id, node_id, symbol, tf }`.
* Central aggregator merges streams into a single timeline.
* `journal_index` monotonic per node, but global sequence assigned in aggregator.
* Operator can filter by account/node in UI.

## 3) Distributed Risk Governance

**Goal:** enforce risk discipline across multiple accounts or nodes.

**Features**

* Central service tracks **global heat caps** across all connected EAs.
* If cap breached ‚Üí sends ‚Äúdisable new trades‚Äù broadcast.
* EA receives via bridge ‚Üí sets `EnableTrading=false`, logs `event:"override" reason:"global_heat_cap"`.
* Optional per-account caps still enforced locally.

## 4) Collaboration Features

* **Shared annotations:** operator can tag journal events (e.g., ‚Äútextbook pullback‚Äù, ‚Äúbad exit‚Äù) and broadcast to all nodes.
* **Operator notes panel**: stored in journal, visible in UI replay.
* **Peer review mode:** two operators can mark trades ‚Äúapproved/denied‚Äù for training archives.

## 5) Offline Sync & Archiving

* If network unavailable ‚Üí EA writes normal local files.
* When network restored ‚Üí auto-sync backlog to central server.
* Archive compression shipped nightly for backup.
* `meta.sync_status` block in snapshots shows pending vs synced.

---

## 6) UI Enhancements

* **Multi-node dashboard**: list active nodes, accounts, versions.
* **Global risk panel**: daily/weekly R usage across all nodes.
* **Filter bar**: node, account, symbol, session.
* **Collaboration tools**: show annotations, comments, approvals.
