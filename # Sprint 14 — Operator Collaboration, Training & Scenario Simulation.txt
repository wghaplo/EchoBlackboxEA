# Sprint 14 ‚Äî Operator Collaboration, Training & Scenario Simulation

## 1) Shared Playbooks

**Goal:** allow operators to co-develop and share tactical playbooks.

**Features**

* Store Playbooks in `/docs/playbooks/*.json` (Orientation, Swing, Scalp, Execution, Maintenance, Edge Cases).
* Each playbook can be versioned (v1.0, v1.1).
* Operators can load alternative playbooks into the EA at runtime (via `PlaybookFile` input).
* UI shows which playbook version is active.
* Journal logs `event:"playbook_load"` when new playbook activated.

## 2) Collaboration Features

**Goal:** create multi-operator feedback loops.

**Features**

* Operator annotations broadcast via Sprint 11 network bridge.
* UI allows operators to ‚Äúlike/dislike‚Äù trades ‚Üí feedback journalled as `event:"operator_feedback"`.
* Shared dashboard: see teammate comments, approvals, and flags in replay.
* Consensus metrics: highlight trades where operator team was aligned vs split.

## 3) Training & Coaching Prompts

**Goal:** help operators learn discipline and sharpen decision making.

**Features**

* EA/ UI generate *coaching prompts* at key events:

  * ‚ÄúYou overrode NO-GO with confluence=0.82. Was this justified?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúHeat cap breached. Would you still have taken this trade?‚Äù
* Operator must tag response in UI (Yes/No/Comment).
* Journal logs responses as `event:"training_prompt"`.

## 4) Scenario Simulation

**Goal:** provide practice environments without risking live equity.

**Features**

* ‚ÄúReplay Mode‚Äù: UI plays back past market + telemetry, operator makes trade calls.
* EA simulates fills and journals as if live (flagged `"simulated":true`).
* ‚ÄúScenario Cards‚Äù: predefined situations (Breakout Fail, Liquidity Sweep) loaded for operator to practice.
* Score report: expectancy, accuracy, discipline index.

---

## 5) Operator Progress Dashboard

* UI tab: **Training & Collaboration**

  * Operator scorecards (accuracy, confluence alignment, override discipline).
  * Heatmap of strengths/weaknesses (trend setups, volume plays, edge cases).
  * Peer comparison (team aggregated vs individual).
* Export training logs for coaching sessions.
